= OpenID Support

Jetty supports authentication using the OpenID Connect protocol (see link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-final.html[OpenID Connect Core 1.0]).
This allows users to authenticate with third party OpenID Providers, making possible to integrate features like "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft", among others.
With OpenID Connect, Jetty applications can offload the responsibility of managing user credentials while enabling features like single sign-on (SSO).

== External Configuration

To use OpenID Connect authentication with Jetty you are required to set up an external OpenID Provider, some examples of this are link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Amazon].
Once you have set up your OpenID Provider you will have access to a Client ID and Client Secret which you can use to configure Jetty.

You must also configure your OpenID Provider to recognize the redirect URIs that your application will use to handle authentication responses.
By default, the redirect path is `/j_security_check`, but this can be customized through the `OpenIdAuthenticator` configuration if needed.

For example, you may wish to register the following URIs:

 * For a deployed application, `+https://example.com/j_security_check+`.
 * For local development, `+http://localhost:8080/j_security_check+`.

Ensure that all relevant environments where your application is deployed have their corresponding URIs registered with the OpenID Provider to avoid authentication errors.

== Jetty Configuration

=== Code Example

This is an example of how you can configure OpenID Connect authentication with an embedded Jetty environment with the Jetty Core API.

=== Application Usage

Here is an example of a Jetty Core `Handler` which handles authenticated requests by accessing the OpenID claims, and also handles authentication errors at `/error`.

==== Claims and Access Token
Claims about the user can be found using attributes in the HTTP session attribute `org.eclipse.jetty.security.openid.claims`, and the full response containing the OAuth 2.0 Access Token can be found in the HTTP session attribute `org.eclipse.jetty.security.openid.response`.

=== Authorization

If security roles are required they can be configured through a nested `LoginService` which is deferred to for user roles.

The nested `LoginService` be configured through the constructor arguments of `OpenIdLoginService`, or left `null` if no user roles are required.

When using authorization roles, the `authenticateNewUsers` setting becomes significant, which can be configured through the `OpenIdConfiguration`, or directly on the `OpenIdLoginService`.

 * If set to `true`, users not known by the nested `LoginService` will still be authenticated but will have no roles.
 * If set to `false`, users not known by the nested `LoginService` will be not be allowed to authenticate and are redirected to the error page.
